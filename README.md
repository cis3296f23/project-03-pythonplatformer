# Python-Platformer
Python Platformer is a 2D platformer game that provides a classical, Super-Mario Bros. experience. The theme around this game is that of Temple University and its mascot, Hooter the Owl.  After clicking through the title screen, the user will be able to control a characterâ€™s movements as the character advances through a level. Like other Platformer games, there will be various obstacles and enemies scattered across the level that the player must avoid. There will also be a leaderboard presented to users to showcase the fastest or best scores.
